# Welcome to my Dumpyard

Welcome to my dumpyard.  
This is my personal junkyard of code, files, and everything in between.  

Here, things get dropped, forgotten, or maybe... discovered.  

---

## About

No fancy rules.  
No specific structure.  
No promises of perfection.

Just a place to throw in whatever I want, whenever I want.

---

## Reminder

This is a **dumpyard**, not a museum.  
**Don't expect pretty things.**

---

## Sections

- `/frontend/` — maybe some UI stuff.
- `/backend/` — maybe some server stuff.
- `/files/` — maybe... just randomness.

(Or maybe not. Who knows?)

---

## License

None.  
Feel free to peek around. Just don't expect anything fancy.
